This might turn into the R cheatsheet eventually, but for now it's just a list of functions we use in the IDS labs. 

```{r} 
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)
```

```{r}
data() #data(cdc)
View() #View(cdc)
dim() #dim(cdc)
nrow() #nrow(cdc)
ncol() #ncol(cdc)
names() #names(cdc)
histogram() #histogram(~height, data = cdc) histogram(~height, data = cdc, nint = 3) histogram(~height | gender, data = cdc) histogram(~height | gender, data = cdc, layout = c(1,2)) histogram(~height, data = cdc, subset = (gender == "Male"))
bargraph() #bargraph(~sunscreen, data = cdc) bargraph(~helmet, data = cdc, horizontal = TRUE) bargraph(~helmet, data = cdc, groups = gender, horizontal = TRUE)
xyplot() #xyplot(weight~height, data = cdc)
```

```{r}
+
-
:
*
==
c() #c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
seq() #seq(from = 5, to = 14, by = 1) seq(from = 5, to = 14, by = 3) seq(5, 14, 1)
sum() #sum(numbers)
cumsum() #cumsum(your_object)
subset() #subset(cdc, asthma == "Yes")
```
