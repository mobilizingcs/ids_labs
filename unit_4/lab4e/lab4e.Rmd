## Making models do yoga

- So far, we have only worked with prediction models that fit the _line of best fit_ to the data.
- What happens if the true relationship between the data is nonlinear?
- In this lab, we will learn about prediction models that fit _best fitting curves_ to data.
- <span class="blue">Before moving on, load the `movie` data and split it into two sets:</span>
    - <span class="blue">A set named `training` that includes 75% of the data.</span>
    - <span class="blue">And a set named `test` that includes the remaining 25%.</span>
    - <span class="blue">Remember to use `set.seed`.</span>


## Problems with lines

- Before learning how to fit curves, let's first fit a linear model for reference.
- <span class="blue">Train a linear model predicting `audience_rating` based on `critics_rating` for the `training` data. Assign this model to `movie_linear`.</span>
- <span class="blue">Fill in the blanks below to create a scatterplot with `audience_rating` on the y-axis and `critics_rating` on the x-axis using your `test` data.</span>
    
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
xyplot(____ ~ ____, data = ____)
```

- Previously, you used `add_line` to plot the _line of best fit_. An alternative function for plotting the _line of best fit_ is `add_curve`, which takes the name of the model as an argument.
- <span class="blue">Run the code below to add the _line of best fit_ for the `training` data to the plot.</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
add_curve(movie_linear)
```

- **Describe, in words, how the line fits the data. Are there any values for `critics_rating` that would make obviously poor predictions?**
    - Hint: how does the linear model perform on very low and very high values of `critics_rating`?
- **Compute the MSE of the linear model for the `test` data and write it down for later.**
    - Hint: refer to lab 4B.


## Adding flexibility

- You don't need to be a full-fledged Data Scientist to realize that trying to fit a line to curved data is a poor modeling choice.
- If our data is curved, we should try to model it with a curve.
- Instead of fitting a line, with equation of the form
<center>`y = a + bx`</center>
- we might consider fitting a _quadratic curve_, with equation of the form
<center>`y = a + bx + cx`<sup>`2`</sup></center>
- or even a _cubic curve_, with equation of the form
<center>`y = a + bx + cx`<sup>`2`</sup>`  + dx`<sup>`3`</sup></center>
- In general, the more coefficients in the model, the more flexible its predictions can be.

```{r, out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("lab4e-figure/polynomials.png")
```


## Making bend-y models

- To fit a quadratic model in `R`, we can use the `poly()` function.
    - <span class="blue">Fill in the blanks below to train a quadratic model predicting `audience_rating` from `critics_rating`, and assign that model to `movie_quad`.</span>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
movie_quad <- lm(____ ~ poly(____, 2), data = training)
```

- **What is the role of the number `2` in the `poly()` function?**

## Comparing lines and curves

- <span class="blue">Fill in the blanks below to</span>
    - <span class="blue">create a scatterplot with `audience_rating` on the y-axis and `critics_rating` on the x-axis using your `test` data, and</span>
    - <span class="blue">add the _line of best fit_ and _best fitting quadratic curve_.</span>
    - Hint: the `col` argument is added to the `add_curve` functions to help distinguish the two curves.
    
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
xyplot(____ ~ ____, data = ____)
add_curve(____, col = "blue")
add_curve(____, col = "red")
```

- **Compare how the _line of best fit_ and the _quadratic_ model fit the data. Which do you think has a lower `test` MSE?**
- **Compute the MSE of the quadratic model for the `test` data and write it down for later**.
- **Use the `test` MSE to explain why one model fits better than the other.**

## On your own

- <span class="blue">Create a model that predicts `audience_rating` using a cubic curve (polynomial with degree `3`), and assign this model to `movie_cubic`.</span>
- <span class="blue">Create a scatterplot with `audience_rating` on the y-axis and `critics_rating` on the x-axis using your `test` data.</span>
- <span class="blue">Using the names of the three models you have trained, add the _line of best fit_, _best fitting quadratic curve_, and _best fitting cubic curve_ for the `training` data to the plot.</span>
- **Based on the plot, which model do you think is the best at predicting the `test` data?**
- **Use the `test` MSE to verify which model is the best at predicting the `test` data.**
