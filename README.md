# IDS Labs

These labs were written for use with the new LAUSD Introduction to Data Science (IDS) math course. Edits will be made to make the labs more open-source/usable.

To use these labs, you'll need a copy of [Rstudio](www.rstudio.com) and install the `MobilizeSimple` package. To install the package, run:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('mobilizingcs/MobilizeSimple')
```

To view the labs in the *Viewer* pane in Rstudio, run the `load_labs()` function and then select the lab you'd like to look at.

Of course, you could always just look in the folders at the `.html` files as well. That'd work.
