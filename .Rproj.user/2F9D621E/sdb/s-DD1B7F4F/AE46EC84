USA!\n=========\n\n- In the previous lab, we cleaned our American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data to make it usable.\n- Now we can actually start to analyze it to learn how people spend their time in the US.\n- The process of cleaning and then analyzing data is very common in Data Science.\n\nUsing Numerical Summaries\n=========================\n\n- Take a look at the following code, but don't run it (yet).\n    - **Based on the code, write down what the plot will display.**\n```{r,eval = FALSE}\nhistogram(~homework | gender, \n          data = atus_clean, \n          subset = homework > 0, \n          layout = c(1,2))\n```\n\n- Now run the code\n- **Based on the plot, do you think that the typical _male_ or the typical _female_ does more homework?**\n\nSummarizing data\n=================================\n\n- Plots are extremely useful.\n    - Help find interesting patterns.\n    - Easy to make comparisons.\n- Plots are also up to interpretation\n    - **Find someone in your class who came to the opposite conclusion as you did about which gender, typically, does more homework**.\n- Instead of relying solely on plots, we can use **summary statistic**.\n    - **Summary statistics** are actual numbers.\n    - Can help make comparisons easier to make.\n\n\nSummarizing Numerical Variables\n===============================\n\n- You've seen lots of **summary statistics** in your class already.\n    - We can use the `mean` or `median` to describe **typical** values.\n    - Can use 'MAD' (mean absolute deviation) and 'sd' (standard deviation) to describe the **spread** of values.\n- Run the following command:\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nhistogram(~sleep, data = atus_clean)\n```\n- **Based on the plot, write down what you think a _typical_ value is for the amount Americans sleep.**\n\nSummarizing Numerical Variables\n===============================\n\n- To find the **typical** number of minutes Americans sleep:\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nmean(~sleep, data = atus_clean)\n```\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nmedian(~sleep, data = atus_clean)\n```\n- **Why do you think the _mean_ and _median_ give slightly different numbers?**\n    - **Check the histogram for `sleep` and see if there might be some values that are bigger/smaller than the smallest/biggest values.**\n\n\nMedian vs. Mean\n===============\n\n- When our data are **skewed**, it's often better to use the **median**.\n    - **Why do you think that is?**\n- Let's look again at the number of hours that _males_ and _females_ spent doing homework (Tossing out everyone who did 0 minutes of homework)\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nhistogram(~homework | gender, \n          data = atus_clean, \n          subset = homework > 0)\n```\n\n- **What's the _shape_ of these distributions?**\n- **Should we use the `median` or `mean` to describe the _typical_ values?**\n\nWhich gender does more homework?\n================================\n\n- On your own:\n    - **Create a `subset` of your data, called `atus_hw` that discards everyone who did 0 minutes of homework.**\n    - Remember the: `subset(data, rule)`, command from lab 1.4.\n    - **Type the following into the console:**\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nmedian(~homework, \n       data = atus_hw, \n       groups = gender)\n```\n\n- **Which gender, typically, does more homework?**\n- **Describe what `groups = gender` does in the code.**\n\nSpread is important too!\n========================\n\n- Now that we know which _gender_ spends more time on homework, we'd like to see just how much the **typical** number **varies**.\n- Using the same `atus_hw` data from before, calculate:\n    \n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nMAD(~homework,\n    data = atus_hw,\n    groups = gender)\n```\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nsd(~homework,\n    data = atus_hw,\n    groups = gender)\n```\n- **Does the time spent on homework vary by very much between the genders?**\n\n\nWhat about categorical variables?\n=================================\n\n- When we're dealing with categorical variables, we lose the ability to calculate `means`, `MAD`s and the like.\n    - (Honestly, what's the `mean` of categories _orange_, _apple_ and _banana_, for instance)\n- Instead of using summary statistics, we calculate **frequency tables**\n\nFrequency tables?\n=================\n\n- When it comes to categories, about all you can do is **count** or **tally** how often each category comes up in the data.\n- Let's calculate how many _males_ and _females_ are in our data set.\n- Type the following into the console:\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\ntally(~gender, data = atus_clean)\n```\n- **How many more _females_ than _males_ are there?**\n\n2-way Frequency Tables\n======================\n\n- Counting the categories of a single variable is nice, but often times we want to make comparisons.\n    - For example, what if we wanted to compare the number of people with phyiscal challanges and their genders?\n- To makes these types of comparisons, we can make a 2-way frequency table:\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\ntally(phys_challenge~gender, data = atus_clean)\n```\n- **Run this command and write down what you notice about numbers of _males_ and _females_ with physical challenges. Are we still counting?**\n\nInterpreting 2-way frequency tables\n===================================\n\n- Recall that  there were `r tally(~gender, data = atus_clean)[2] - tally(~gender, data = atus_clean)[1]` more women than men in our data set.\n    - Comparing **counts** then doesn't make sense.\n    - If there are more women, then we might also expect to have more women who have a physical challenge (compared to men).\n- Instead of using **counts**, we use **percentages**\n    - So for instance, roughly `r tally(phys_challenge~gender, data = atus_clean)[1,1] * 100`% of men do not have a physical difficulty.\n    \nOn your own\n===========\n\n- **Which gender has a higher rate of _part time employment_?**\n- **Explore the amount of time each gender socializes**\n    - **Create a subset of data of people who socialized at least 1 minute or more**\n    - **Compare the average amount of socializing done by each gender**\n    - **Does one gender's amount of socializing vary more than the other?**\n\n\n\n\n",
