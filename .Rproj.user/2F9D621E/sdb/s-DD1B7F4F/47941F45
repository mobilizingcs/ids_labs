How are they similar? Different?**\n    \n    \nWatch out! \n==========\n\n- You might want to `subset` your data so you compare apples to apples. \n    - For instance, not all Americans are in school, and so will spend 0 minutes doing homework.\n    - It would be better to make comparisons using just the subset of the data of people who did at least 1 minute of homework.\n    - Then you can compare how much time your class spends on homework against other people who also spend at least some time doing homework.\n    \nAnd away you go:\n================\n\n- *assignment?*",
