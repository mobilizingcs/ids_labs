Finding patterns in data.
=========================================

- To discover (_really_) interesting observations or relationships in data, we need to find them!
    - Which is difficult if we only look at the raw data.
- The best tool for finding patterns is often ... your own eyes.
    - Plots are an excellent way to help your eye search for patterns.
- In this lab, we'll learn how to include more variables in our plots to make them more informative.
- Import the data from your class' _Food Habits_ campaign and name it `food`.


Where's the variables?
========================

- **How many variables were used to create this plot? Which variables were used and how were they used?**

Multiple variable plots
=======================

- The previous graph is an example of a _multiple variable plot_, which means that more than a single variable was used. In this case:
  - Variable 1: _height_
  - Variable 2: _gender_
- Multiple variable plots are tools for finding _relationships_ between data.
- Let's take our `food` data and make some new multiple variable plots you haven't created before!

scatterplots
=============

Creating scatterplots
======================

- Scatterplots are useful for viewing how one _numerical_ variable relates to another _numerical_ variable.
- Fill in the blanks to create a scatterplot with `sodium` on the y-axis and `sugar` on the x-axis.

```r
xyplot(____ ~ ____, data = food)
```


Scatterplots in action
======================================

- Use a scatterplot to answer the following questions:
    - **Do snacks that have more `calories` also have more `total_fat`? Why do you think that?**
    - **What happens if you swap the `calories` and `total_fat` variables in your code? Does the relationship between the variables change?**
    - **Does the relationship between `calories` and `total_fat` change when the snack is either `Salty` or `Sweet`? Write down the code you used to answer this question.**

4-variable scatterplots
======================

- When we make scatterplots, we can include:
    - 1 numerical variable on the x-axis
    - 1 numerical variable on the y-axis
    - Use 1 categorical variable to facet our scatterplot
    - Change the color of the points based on another categorical variable
- To change the color of our points, we can include the `groups` argument  much like we did for bargraphs (use the _search_ feature in the _History_ pane if you need help).
- **Create a scatterplot that uses these 4 variables: `sodium`, `sugar`, `healthy_level`, `salty_sweet`.**


Multiple facets
===============

- It can sometimes be helpful to facet on more than 1 variable.
    - Splitting the the data using 2 facets can give us additional insights that might otherwise be hidden.
- Create a `dotPlot` or `histogram` of the `calories` variable, but facet the data using:

```r
healthy_level + salty_sweet 
```
- **How does the `healthy_level` of a `Salty` or `Sweet` snack impact the number of `calories` in the snack?.**


On your own
===========

- Answer the following questions by creating an appropriate graph or graphs.
    - **Do healthier snacks `cost` more or less than less healthy snacks?**
    - **What other variables seem to be related to the `cost` of a snack? Describe their relationships.**
