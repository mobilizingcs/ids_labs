Previously ...
==============

- In the previous lab, we learned that by using a `do`-loop and the `shuffle` function, we could simulate randomly shuffling our data many times.
  - This helps us determine how likely it is that a difference between groups is due to chance.
- For this lab, will extend these ideas to _numerical_ variables by using random shuffling and numerical summaries.
- The question we will investigate in this lab is:

_Is there any evidence to suggest that wealthier passengers on the Titanic were more likely to survive than poorer passengers?_

- We will consider wealthier passengers to be those that paid a higher `fare` for their ticket.



The Titanic
===========

- The Titanic was a ship that sank en route to the U.S.A. from England after hitting an Iceberg in 1912.
    - At the time, it was claimed that the Titanic was _unsinkable_ ... it wasn't ... because it did.
- Use the `data` function to load the `titanic` passenger and survival data.
- Create a boxplot of the `fare`s paid by passengers and facet the plot based on whether the passenger survived or not.
    - **Based on the plot, do you believe richer passengers were more likely to survive? Explain why and describe how certain you are of being correct.**


The search begins!
=======================

- Start your analysis by calculating how much more the _typical_ survivor paid than the _typical_ non-survivor in our data.
    - Based on the distributions of fares paid, which numerical summary that describes the _typical_ value might be preferred?
- **What was the _typical_ fare paid by survivors? Non-survivors? How much more did the typical survivor pay?**

Do the shuffle!
==============

- Use the `do` and the `shuffle` functions to shuffle the passenger's survival status 500 times.
    - Use the previous lab if you need some help on how to do this.
    - For each shuffle, compute each group's `median` fare paid. 
    - `Assign` your shuffled data the name `shuffles`.
- After shuffling your data, use the `mutate` function to create a variable called `diff` to the shuffled medians you just calculated. (Assign your mutated data the name `shuffles` again).
  

Put your simulations to use
===============================

- **By using your shuffled data, answer the research question we posed at the beginning of the lab.**

_Is there any evidence to suggest that wealthier passengers on the Titanic were more likely to survive than poorer passengers?_

- **Write up your answer as a statistical analysis. Create a plot and explain how the plot supports your conclusion. Be sure to also explain why shuffling your data is important.**
