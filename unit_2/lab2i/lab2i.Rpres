Where we're headed
===

- In the last lab, you were able to overlay a normal curve on histograms of data to help you decide if the data's distribution is close to a normal distribution.
    - We also saw that calculating the `mean` of random shuffles also produces differences that are normally distributed.
- In this lab, we'll learn how to use some other `R` functions to:
    - Simulate random draws from a normal distribution.
    - Calculate probabilities with normal distributions.


Get set up
===

- Start by loading the `titanic` data and calculate the `mean` `age` of people in the data but `shuffle` their `survival` status 500 times.
    - `Assign` this data the name `shfls`.
- After creating `shfls`, use `mutate` to add a new variable to the data set. This new variable should have the name `diff` and should be the `age` of those who survived minus those who died.
- Finally, calculate the `mean` and `sd` of the `diff` variable.
    - `Assign` these values the name `diff_mean` and `diff_sd`.


Is it normal?
===

- Before we proceed, we need to verify that our `diff` variable looks approximately normally distributed.
    - **Is the distribution close to normal? Explain how you determined this. Describe the center and spread of the distribution.**
    - **Compute the mean difference in the age of the _actual_ survivors and the actual non-survivors.**


Using the normal model
===

- Since the distribution of our `diff` variable appears normally distributed, we can use a normal model to estimate the probability of seeing differences that are more extreme than our actual data.
- Fill in the blanks to calculate the probability of an even smaller difference occurring than our actual difference using a normal model.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pnorm(____, mean = diff_mean, sd = ____)
```


Extreme probabilities
===

- The probability you calculated in the previous slide is an estimate for how often we expect to see a difference smaller than the actual one we observed, by chance alone.
    - **Draw a sketch of a normal curve. Label the mean age difference, based on your shuffles, and the actual age difference of suvivors minus non-survivors from the actual data. Then shade in the areas, under normal the curve, that are _smaller_ than the actual difference.**
- If you wanted to instead calculate the probability that the difference would be larger than the one observed, we could run (fill in the blanks):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
1 - pnorm(____, mean = diff_mean, sd = ____)
```


Simulating normal draws
========================

- We can simulate random draws from a normal distribution with the `rnorm` function.
    - Fill in the blanks in the following two lines of code to simulate 100 heights of randomly chosen men. Assume the `mean` height is 67 inches and the `standard deviation` is 3 inches.  
    - Plot your simulated heights with a `histogram`.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
draws <- rnorm(____, mean = ____, sd = ____)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
histogram(draws, fit = ____)
```


P's and Q's
===

- We've seen that we can use `pnorm` to calculate _probabilities_ based on a specified _quantity_.
    - Hence, why we call it "P" norm.
- Now we'll see how to do the opposite. That is, calculate a the _quantity_ for a specific _probability_.
    - Hence why we'll call this a "Q" norm.
- How tall can you be and still be in the shortest 25% of heights if the mean height is 67 inches with a standard deviation of 3 inches?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
qnorm(____, mean = ____, sd = ____)
```




On your own
===

- Using the `titanic` data, answer the following statistical question:
    - **Were women on the Titanic typically younger than men?**
    - **Use a histogram, 500 random shuffles and a normal model to answer the question in the bullet above.**
